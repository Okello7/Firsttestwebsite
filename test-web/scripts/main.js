    The code uses a conditional to check if the src value is equal to the path of the original image:
        If it is, the code changes the src value to the path of the second image, forcing the other image to be loaded inside the <img> element.
        If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the src value swaps back to the original image path, to the original state.

 The setUserName() function contains a prompt() function, which displays a dialog box, similar to alert().

 In this case, we are asking the user to enter a name. Next, the code calls on an API localStorage, which allows us to store data in the browser and retrieve it later.
 We use localStorage's setItem() function to create and store a data item called 'name', setting its value to the myName variable which contains the user's entry for the name.
 Finally, we set the textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's newly stored name.
