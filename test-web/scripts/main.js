You stored a reference to your <img> element in myImage. Next, you made its onclick event handler property equal to a function with no name (an "anonymous" function). So every time this element is clicked:

    The code retrieves the value of the image's src attribute.
    The code uses a conditional to check if the src value is equal to the path of the original image:
        If it is, the code changes the src value to the path of the second image, forcing the other image to be loaded inside the <img> element.
        If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the src value swaps back to the original image path, to the original state.
