    <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly.
    <br>With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more</p>
    <p>
        JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible.
        Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language,
         unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.
         These include:

    <ul><li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers,
        providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles;
        collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam,
        or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
    <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers,
         such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
    <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to 
        HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
