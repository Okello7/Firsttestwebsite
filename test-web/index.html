        the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.
             This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
    -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!--
        This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it.
        There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <!--
        This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport,
        preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.

        This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.
        It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.

    To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. my-image.jpg.
    To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, e.g. subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
    To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking HTML file, write two dots. So for example, if index.html was inside a subfolder of test-site and my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ../my-image.jpg.
    You can combine these as much as you like, for example ../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg.

    -->
    <!--
        The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all.
        A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."

    <i>The opening tag:</i> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.<br/> 
    This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
    The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
    This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
    The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
    The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
